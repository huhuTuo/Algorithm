Project: "490. The Maze" - LC - Breadth-First Traversal
490. The Maze - (local copy) - Medium
Depth-First Traversal - does not find the Shortest Path
Breadth-First Traversal - find the Shortest Path
Process
Step 1: Complete Project : "490. The Maze" - LC - Depth-First Traversal
Step 2: Redo the project using Breath-First Traversal
  Step 2.1: Manual process to demonstrate concepts using Breadth-First Traversal to solve this problem
  Step 2.2: Reimplement a Python solution using the algorithm Breadth-First Traversal
      To prove that you can convert a concept into a program (Sample code) and test the program based on all the test cases provided by LeetCode 490. The Maze - (local copy)
      Please study the programs. Since the program is provided, there is not much you can do if you decide not to study the programs.
  Step 2.3: Update your portfolio about the Maze project
  You can create a seperate slides for this project or enhance the Google Slides created from Project : "490. The Maze" - LC - Depth-First Traversal.
  Please use this structure to describe the project

     Breadth First Search
         Maze   
  Step 2.4: Submit the URL of your GitHub webpage as the homework answer.
